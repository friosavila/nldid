- Among others, Andrew showed the problems of using TWFE in the presence of staggered adoption of the treatment.

- Because of treatment timing, later treated units are compared to **bad** controls (early treated ones), in potential violation of the parallel trends assumption.

- This also relates to negative weights.

- Pedro and Brantly proposed deconstructing the GxT problem. Consider only good 2x2 DD designs to identify Treatment effects in DID.
- Agregate them as needed to obtain the desired treatment effect (weighted Average). (dynamic, average, across time, across groups, etc)
  
- Along with **Jonathan Roth**, discuss the problem of PTA and function forms. Not all may be valid.

- Jeff Wooldridge brought back life to the **TWFE**. 
- The problem was not the **TWFE** part of the analysis, but the model specification. 
  - ($post \times treated$ instead of $G \times T$)
- This insights, can be extended to nonlinear cases, which have been nicely packaged in `jwdid`.

- I have followed some of the developments in DID with staggered adoption of the treatment. 
  - Implemented few things (`drdrd`/`csdid`/`csdid2`/`jwdid`)
  - Understood few others (comparison groups, efficiency, negative weights, nonlinear models)
- And today, I will be providing some of my insights regarding the empirical analysis of nonlinear DID.
  - I will rely heavily on [Wooldridge(2023)](https://academic.oup.com/ectj/article/26/3/C31/7250479), 
  - and to some extent on [Roth and Sant'Anna (2023)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/ECTA19402)

## Introduction

- **Differences in Differences** (DiD) design is one of the most popular methods in applied microeconomics, because it requires relatively few assumptions to identify treatment effects.
  - No anticipation,
  - Parallel trends,
  - No spillovers
- The canonical DiD, a 2x2 design, simply compares means (or conditional means) of the outcome variable (before after x treated non-treated) to identify treatment effects. 
  - Thus it can be used even if outcome is a limited dependent variable (binary, count, etc) (parallel to the linear regression case)

## 

- Because the Canonical design is rather limited, many extensions have been proposed to handle more complex scenarios: Staggered Treatment with **GxT DID**.
  - Early Extensions (infamous TWFE) have been shown to be problematic. (negative weights and bad controls)
  - but more recent approaches (See Roth and Sant'Anna 2023) have shown how can one better use these designs to identify treatment effects, avoiding the simple-TWFE problems.

- Linear models, however, have limitations:
  - Linear models do a poor job interpolating and predicting LDV outcomes
  - Parallel trends assumptions may only be credible under specific functional forms

- Among others, Andrew showed the problems of using TWFE in the presence of staggered adoption of the treatment.

- Because of treatment timing, later treated units are compared to **bad** controls (early treated ones), in potential violation of the parallel trends assumption.

- This also relates to negative weights.

- Pedro and Brantly proposed deconstructing the GxT problem. Consider only good 2x2 DD designs to identify Treatment effects in DID.
- Agregate them as needed to obtain the desired treatment effect (weighted Average). (dynamic, average, across time, across groups, etc)
  
- Along with **Jonathan Roth**, discuss the problem of PTA and functional forms. Not all may be valid.

- I have followed some of the developments in DID with staggered adoption of the treatment. 
  - Implemented few things (`drdid`/`csdid`/`csdid2`/`jwdid`)
  - Understood few others (comparison groups, efficiency, negative weights, nonlinear models)
- And today, I will be providing some of my insights regarding the empirical analysis of nonlinear DID.
  - I will rely heavily on [Wooldridge(2023)](https://academic.oup.com/ectj/article/26/3/C31/7250479), 
  - and to some extent on [Roth and Sant'Anna (2023)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/ECTA19402)

## Basics: 2x2 DiD

- In the 2x2 DID design, we have 2 groups:
  - Control ($D=0$) and treated ($D=1$), 
- Which are observed for two periods of time:
  - Before ($T=0$) and after ($T=1$) the treatment.

- For all groups and periods of time, we observe the *realized* outcome $Y_{i,t}$, but cannot observe all *potential* outcomes $Y_{i,t}(D)$.

- Realized outcomes are determined by the following equation:

$$Y_{i,t}=D_i Y_{i,t}(1) + (1-D_i) Y_{i,t}(0)
$$

## 

If treatment occured at some point between T0 and T1, the estimate of interested, Average Treatment effect, could be estimated as follows:

$$ATT = E(Y_{i,1}(1) - Y_{i,1}(0)|D_i=1)
$$

For the treated, we observe $Y_{i,1}(1)$, but cannot observe $Y_{i,t}(0)$ (counterfactual), thus, to identify Treatment Effects, we need to impose some assumptions.

- PTA: 
  
$$\begin{aligned}
E(Y_{i,1}(0) - Y_{i,0}(0)|D_i=1) &= E(Y_{i,1} - Y_{i,0}|D_i=0) \\
E(Y_{i,1}(0)|D_i=1) &= E(Y_{i,0}(0)|D_i=1) + E(Y_{i,1} - Y_{i,0}|D_i=0) 
\end{aligned}
$$

- No Anticipation: 
$$Y_{i,0}(1) =  Y_{i,0}(0)=Y_{i,0}$$

## 

Thus, ATT can be estimated as follows:

$$\begin{aligned}
ATT &= E(Y_{i,1}(1)|D_i=1)-E(Y_{i,1}(0)|D_i=1) \\
&= E(Y_{i,1}|D_i=1)- \Big(E(Y_{i,0}|D_i=1) + E(Y_{i,1} - Y_{i,0}|D_i=0)  \Big) \\
&= E(Y_{i,1}-Y_{i,0}|D_i=1)- E(Y_{i,1} - Y_{i,0}|D_i=0)  
\end{aligned}
$$

- And the Same could be done via Regressions:

$$y_{i,t} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 T + \beta_2 D_i + \theta (D_i \times T) + \epsilon_{i,t}
$$

- ATT identification relies on the Parallel trend assumption. 

## How to test for PTA?

- PTA is a non-testable assumption, because we do not observe all potential outcomes.
- However, if we "move", from the 2x2 design, it may be possible to test if PTA hold Before treatment.

- Consider a case of T periods of time, and that treatment happen at period G.

- Say we estimate the ATT comparing periods T and T-1, for any T<G.

$$ATT(T) = E(Y_{i,T} - Y_{i,T-1}|D_i=1) - E(Y_{i,T} - Y_{i,T-1}|D_i=0)
$$

- If there is no anticipation, and Parallel trends hold, then $ATT(T)=0 \text{ if } T<G$ 
  - This is what @callaway2021 uses for PTA testing

## How to test for PTA

- Alternatively, one could simply estimate all ATT's using period G-1 as baseline period:

$$ATT^2(T) = E(Y_{i,T} - Y_{i,G-1}|D_i=1) - E(Y_{i,T} - Y_{i,G-1}|D_i=0)
$$
 
- And use all post-treatment periods to estimate the ATT ($T\geq G$)
- and use all pre-treatment periods to test for PTA ($T<G$)

## What if PTA does not hold?

- As suggested by Wooldridge (2023), one of the reasons PTA may not hold is because we may be analyzing the wrong model.

  - consider two groups of workers, high and low earners, that experience the same wage growth. (parallel trends in relative terms)
  - If we observe wages at levels, parallel trends would be violated
  - And Post treatment estimates will be missleading

## PTA may hold for $G(\bar Y)$

A similar story could be told about other types of transformations.

In general, it is possible that PTA hold for some other monotonic transformation of the outcome variable.

$$G^{-1}\Big( E_1 [Y_{i,1}(0)] \Big) -G^{-1}\Big(E_1[ Y_{i,0}(0) ] \Big)  
= G^{-1}\Big(E_0[Y_{i,1}]\Big) - G^{-1}\Big(E_0[Y_{i,0}]\Big)$$

This is very similar to the PTA assumption explored in Roth and Sant'Anna (2023).

$$E_1\Big[g(Y_{i,1}(0))\Big] - E_1\Big[g(Y_{i,0}(0))\Big] = E_0\Big[g(Y_{i,1})\Big] - E_0\Big[g(Y_{i,0})\Big]
$$

Wooldridge idea: It may be possible to identify ATTs using correct functional forms, through the latent index.

## How do things Change?

- Using this insight, we can go back to the 2x2 design, and see how things change.

Before: 

$$E(y_{i,t}|D,T)=\beta_0 + \beta_1 T + \beta_2 D_i + \theta (D_i \times T)
$$

After:

$$E(y_{i,t}|D,T)=G\Big(\beta_0 + \beta_1 T + \beta_2 D_i + \theta (D_i \times T)\Big)
$$

- For the practitioner, the extended Nonlinear DID simply requires choosing a functional form that better fits the data.
  - Poisson, logit, ~~fractional regression~~, multinomial model, Linear model, etc
  - Although, there is little gain in the simple 2x2 DID design.

## Extension I: Adding Covariates

- Many papers in the literature consider the use of covariates in the estimation of the ATT.
  
- The lessons from Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020):
  - The choosen covariates should be time fixed, to avoid contamination of the treatment effect.
  - Using covariates allows relaxing the parallel trends assumption: PTA hold for specific groups of individuals. (if not for the whole population due to compositional changes)
- In the 2x2 DID-Regression, covariates can be added with interactions:

$$\begin{aligned}
y_{i,t} &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 D + \beta_2 T + \theta (D \times T) \\
&+ X\gamma +  D \times X\gamma_d + T \times X\gamma_T + D \times T (X-\bar X )\lambda + \epsilon_{i,t}
\end{aligned}
$$

- The same could be done in the nonlinear case

## Extension II: GxT DiD

- The 2x2 design is rather limited, because often people have access to multiple periods of time, with differential treatment timing. (staggered adoption of the treatment)
  - I call this the GxT design (G groups, T periods of time) 
- The majority of the papers that analyze this case impose an additional assumption: 
  - Treatment is not Reversable: Once treated always treated

##
### The Problem

- Early extensions of the 2x2 design to the GxT design, relied on the **TWFE** estimator. 
$$y_{i,t} = \delta_i + \delta_t + \theta^{fe} D_{i,t} + e_{i,t}$$

where $D_{i,t}=1$ only after treatment is in place, and zero otherwise.

- This model has been shown to be problematic, because of How OLS estimates the $\theta^{fe}$ parameter.
  - $\theta^{fe}$ is a weighted average of all possible 2x2 DID designs.
  - Some designs use early treated units as controls for late treated units, which might be a violation of the parallel trends assumption. 
    - (treated units effectively receiving negative weights) @goodmanbacon2021, @dechaisemartin2020 and @borusyak2023revisiting 

##
### Avoiding the Problem

- @callaway2021 proposes a simple solution: Deconstruct the problem into smaller pieces (2x2 DIDs), and aggregate them as needed.

- @wooldridge2022, however, proposes a different solution: Use the correct functional form to estimate the ATTs.

$$\text{Instead of: }Y_{i,t} = \delta_i + \gamma_t  + \theta^{fe} PT_{i,t} + \epsilon_{i,t}$$

$$\text{Use: }Y_{i,t} = \delta_i + \gamma_t  + \sum_{g \in \mathbb{G}} \sum_{t=g}^T \theta_{g,t} \mathbb{1}(G=g,T=t) + \epsilon_{i,t}$$

- Both of them suggest, embrace heterogeneity across time and cohorts.

## An added Insight

- The approach proposed by @wooldridge2022, is more efficient than @callaway2021, because it uses all pre-treatment data to estimate the ATTs. (@callaway2021 uses only one pre-treatment data from the treated)

- However, doing this doesnt allow you to test for PTA directly, unless we use an alternative approach:

$$Y_{i,t} = \delta_i + \gamma_t  + 
\sum_{g \in \mathbb{G}} \sum_{t=t_0}^{g-2} \theta_{g,t}^{pre} \mathbb{1}(G=g,T=t) +
\sum_{g \in \mathbb{G}} \sum_{t=g}^T \theta_{g,t}^{post} \mathbb{1}(G=g,T=t) + \epsilon_{i,t}$$

- This specification is equivalent to @callaway2021 and to @sunabraham2021. 
  - Its explicily a regression (Wooldridge)
  - and uses actual, instead of relative, time.
 
## Implementing NL-DID the `JW` way

- One of the advantages of the approaches proposed by @wooldridge2 and wooldridge2023, is that they can be directly estimated using regressions.
- The hard part is to construct all the interactions required for the model to work.
- And a second challenge is to decide how to aggregate the results.

**`jwdid`**

- `jwdid` is a simple command that helps with the construction of all required interactions that could be used to implement Wooldridge approach.
- It is flexible enough, in that it allows you to choose different estimators that would better fit your data.
- it comes with its own post estimation commands that can help you aggregate the results into simple ATT, dynamics effects, across periods, across years, etc.

- Lets take it for a Sin

## Command Syntax

- `jwdid` - Command Name. In charge of getting all interactions -right-
  - `depvar` `[indepvar]` - Declare the dependent variables. Independent variables are optional. They should be time fixed.
  - `[if]` `[in]` `[weight]`, Declares sample and weights. Only `PW` is allowed. 

## Command Main Options

- `jwdid`: main options
  - `ivar(varname)`: Panel indicator. If not declared, command assumes one is using repeated cross sections.
  - `cluster(varname)`: Cluster variable. To request a clustered standard error other than at `ivar` level. Recommended with RC.
  - `tvar(varname)` or `time(varname)`: Required, Time variable. There are two ways to call it for compatability with `csdid`.
  - `gvar(varname)`: Group variable. Indicates the timing of when a unit has ben treated.
  - `trtvar(varname)`: If using Panel data, one could instead provide the post-treatment dummy.
  	- If data is repeated crossection, one requires using `trgvar(varname)` (Pseudo panel indicator).

## Extra Options

- `group`: Requests using group fixed effects, instead of individual fixed effects (default)
- `never`: Request to use alternative specification that allows to test for PTA. (default is to use the standard specification)
- Linear and Nonlinear models:
  - `method(command, options)`: Request to use a specific method to model the data. Default is using linear regression via `reghdfe`. 
  - the option part allows you do include specific options for the method. (e.g. `method(logit, robust)`)

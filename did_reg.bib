  abstract={This paper assesses when the validity of difference‐in‐differences depends on functional form. We provide a novel characterization: the parallel trends assumption holds under all strictly monotonic transformations of the outcome if and only if a stronger “parallel trends”‐type condition holds for the cumulative distribution function of untreated potential outcomes. This condition for parallel trends to be insensitive to functional form is satisfied if and essentially only if the population can be partitioned into a subgroup for which treatment is effectively randomly assigned and a remaining subgroup for which the distribution of untreated potential outcomes is stable over time. These conditions have testable implications, and we introduce falsification tests for the null that parallel trends is insensitive to functional form.},

abstract = {The canonical difference-in-differences (DD) estimator contains two time periods, ”pre” and ”post”, and two groups, ”treatment” and ”control”. Most DD applications, however, exploit variation across groups of units that receive treatment at different times. This paper shows that the two-way fixed effects estimator equals a weighted average of all possible two-group/two-period DD estimators in the data. A causal interpretation of two-way fixed effects DD estimates requires both a parallel trends assumption and treatment effects that are constant over time. I show how to decompose the difference between two specifications, and provide a new analysis of models that include time-varying controls.}

We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our proposed tools by analyzing the effect of the minimum wage on teen employment from 2001–2007. Open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methods.},

            Linear regressions with period and group fixed effects are widely used to estimate policie’s effects: 26 of the 100 most cited papers published by the American Economic Review from 2015 to 2019 estimate such regressions. It has recently been shown that those regressions may produce misleading estimates if the policy’s effect is heterogeneous between groups or over time, as is often the case. This survey reviews a fast-growing literature that documents this issue and that proposes alternative estimators robust to heterogeneous effects. We use those alternative estimators to revisit Wolfers (2006a).},

            I derive simple, flexible strategies for difference-in-differences settings where the nature of the response variable may warrant a nonlinear model. I allow for general staggered interventions, with and without covariates. Under an index version of parallel trends, I show that average treatment effects on the treated (ATTs) are identified for each cohort and calendar time period in which a cohort was subjected to the intervention. The pooled quasi-maximum likelihood estimators in the linear exponential family extend pooled ordinary least squares estimation of linear models. By using the conditional mean associated with the canonical link function, imputation and pooling across the entire sample produce identical estimates. Generally, pooled estimation results in very simple computation of the ATTs and their standard errors. The leading cases are a logit functional form for binary and fractional outcomes—combined with the Bernoulli quasi-log likelihood (QLL)—and an exponential mean combined with the Poisson QLL.},

We propose an alternative estimator that is free of contamination, and illustrate the relative shortcomings of two-way fixed effects regressions with leads and lags through an empirical application.},

In contrast to alternative DID estimators, the proposed estimators are consistent if either (but not necessarily both) a propensity score or outcome regression working models are correctly specified. We also derive the semiparametric efficiency bound for the ATT in DID designs when either panel or repeated cross-section data are available, and show that our proposed estimators attain the semiparametric efficiency bound when the working models are correctly specified. Furthermore, we quantify the potential efficiency gains of having access to panel data instead of repeated cross-section data. Finally, by paying particular attention to the estimation method used to estimate the nuisance parameters, we show that one can sometimes construct doubly robust DID estimators for the ATT that are also doubly robust for inference. Simulation studies and an empirical application illustrate the desirable finite-sample performance of the proposed estimators.

	abstract = {In this paper, we study difference-in-differences identification and estimation strategies where the parallel trends assumption holds after conditioning on time-varying covariates and/or time-invariant covariates. Our first main contribution is to point out a number of weaknesses of commonly used two-way fixed effects (TWFE) regressions in this context. In addition to issues related to multiple periods and variation in treatment timing that have been emphasized in the literature, we show that, even in the case with only two time periods, TWFE regressions are not generally robust to (i) paths of untreated potential outcomes depending on the level of time-varying covariates (as opposed to only the change in the covariates over time), (ii) paths of untreated potential outcomes depending on time-invariant covariates, and (iii) violations of linearity conditions for outcomes over time and/or the propensity score. Even in cases where none of the previous three issues hold, we show that TWFE regressions can suffer from negative weighting and weight-reversal issues. Thus, TWFE regressions can deliver misleading estimates of causal effect parameters in a number of empirically relevant cases. Second, we extend these arguments to the case of multiple periods and variation in treatment timing. Third, we provide simple diagnostics for assessing the extent of misspecification bias arising due to TWFE regressions. Finally, we propose alternative (and simple) estimation strategies that can circumvent these issues with two-way fixed regressions.},
